# Problem Set 04

These problems are to challenge your understanding of nested looping over
arrays, two dimensional arrays and matrices.

## Setup

1. Download this practice from GitHub.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `mocha` to run all specs.

## Instructions

Your goal is to solve each problem so that all specs are passing.

These problems entail the following challenges as the primary objectives:

- `pairsMaker()`: generating a two dimensional array based off an array input.
- `twoSum()`: searching with nested loops for a calculated target.
- `twoDimensionalProduct()`: looping through nested arrays to calculate a value.
- `maxInMatrix()`: looping through a matrix to determine the largest value.
- `zip()`: creating a two dimensional array by combining elements of two
different arrays.

For additional tests that may help with debugging you can comment in
`console.log()` statements in each file, then run
`node <problem-relative-file-path>` in your terminal. For example,
`node problems/01-pairs-maker.js`

You can run tests for specific problems with `mocha test/<problem-spec-file>`.
For example, `mocha test/01-pairs-maker-spec.js`

## Submission

Once all of your specs are passing, prepare your work for submission by:

1. Delete the __/node_modules__ folder.
2. Zip up the entire folder including code and specs.
3. Submit your zipped file.
